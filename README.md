# JS-Pokedex
A Pokedex web application that will display a gallery of Pokemon with images. Users should be able to choose to load more Pokemon, view details about a specific Pokemon, and mark Pokemon as "caught".

Features:
Pokémon List Display: Display a list of Pokémon fetched from the PokeAPI.
Lazy Loading: Load more Pokémon as the user scrolls down using a "Load More" button.
Pokémon Details: Show detailed information (image, abilities, types) for each Pokémon in a dialog.
Catch Pokémon: Allow users to catch Pokémon, storing caught Pokémon in localStorage.
Release Pokémon: Enable users to release caught Pokémon, updating the UI dynamically.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Dialog Interface: Use HTML dialog element for displaying Pokémon details with a close button.
Techniques:
Asynchronous JavaScript: Utilize async/await for fetching data from the PokeAPI asynchronously.
LocalStorage: Store caught Pokémon locally using localStorage to persist data between sessions.
DOM Manipulation: Dynamically create HTML elements and manipulate the DOM to update UI based on user actions.
Event Handling: Attach event listeners to interactive elements like Pokémon cards and buttons.
CSS Transitions: Use CSS transitions (transform, transition) for smooth animations when interacting with Pokémon cards.
API Integration: Integrate with the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data including images, abilities, and types.
Error Handling: Implement error handling for API requests and data fetching to provide a robust user experience.
ES6+ Features: Employ modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, template literals, and let/const declarations.
